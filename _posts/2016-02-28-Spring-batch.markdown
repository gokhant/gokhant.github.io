Of course this is not a cafe called *Batch*, only *Spring Batch* is here and there are no cupcakes nor espressos here, sorry for that.

If you've come this far, you have already read [51-Do you love Spring or hate it?][link-51], if not please do so.
In order to continue, ***knowing*** basic [Spring](http://www.spring.io), [some annotations](https://dzone.com/refcardz/spring-annotations) and [Apache Maven](http://maven.apache.org) is required, only then you may get the best of this post.

As I mentioned [earlier][link-51], I need to process CSV files with sizes varying from 180 to 500 MBs. These files contain base stations and number of subscribers according to their 
distances to the base station (*I may sometimes use **cell** from now on*) on an hourly basis. The aim is finding the area with the greatest number of subscribers by using these files.
At this point let's talk about some GSM concepts very superficially:

> *Distances* are calculated according to [timing advance (TA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timing_advance) or [propagation delay (PD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propagation_delay). 
Both of them are very briefly the length of time a signal takes to travel between the base station and the mobile phone. Let's also add that TA is for 2G and PD is 3G.
\\
\\
> Let's assume that blue marker 0 below identifies our 3G serving cell's location. This cell has a beamwidth[^beamwidth] of 67<sup>o</sup> and the arc drawn in navy blue has a radius of 234 m. The people in this arc mostly have a PD of 0. 
> Each PD value denotes a distance of 234 m; such as subscribers with PD 1 will be mostly between 234m and 468m to the serving cell. In order to draw this, azimuth of the cell is also required, which is 60<sup>o</sup> by the way; 
but I will tell about azimuth and beamwidth later, in another post.

Let's return back to the csv files, below is a sample for 3G. As you can see, there is one line for every hour for a cell, meaning each cell contains 24 lines of data which should be accumulated before being used.
Imagine the size of the file with more than 100K cells!

For starters, here is the *pom.xml*, using not only Spring Batch but also Spring Boot which enables to code easier and faster after some learning curve.

Initial source codes are in **[gokhant@github](https://github.com/gokhant/spring-batch-example).**
When I first wrote it, I saw that processor runs for every line in the file, as I stated above, lines are related with each other.
I have to find a solution to **merge** the lines, but how? Stay tuned, coming up.
