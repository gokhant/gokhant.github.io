			<strong>52</strong> is a comic book series by <a href="http://www.dccomics.com">DC</a>, telling the aftermath of Infinite Crisis series. 
			It has been published weekly for one year (52 issues) where majority of the standart comic book publications are (still) monthly. 
			By the way, both <i>52</i> and <i>Infinite Crisis</i> are outstanding examples of DC comic books series, but this is a topic for another day.

According to [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601), 52 is the number of weeks in most of the years and it’s also the number 
of blog posts I will try to reach in a year starting from this post’s publish date. 


Make no worries, this post doesn’t count, i will count from 52 in a descending order for each title 
of my blog post. I sincerely hope to achieve not only the quantity but also a certain quality in my posts.
